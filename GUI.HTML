            The goal of this research is to make the
current software metrics more security-centric by identifying
threshold values for the metrics based on which a file can be
interpreted as a vulnerable file. This research will assist the
developers in secure software development through the security
assessment of their code using the values of the metrics.

To accomplish our goal, we will characterize the software metrics
so that they can capture security specific properties of code. For
this, we will identify the threshold limits for existing software
metrics beyond which a code acts vulnerable.
